# Chatbot


In this project, I am going to use the Reformer, also known as the efficient Transformer, to generate a dialogue between two bots. In this we will feed conversations to our model and it will learn how to understand the context of each one. Not only will it learn how to answer questions but it will also know how to ask questions if it needs more info. For example, after a customer asks for a train ticket, the chatbot can ask what time the said customer wants to leave. We can use this concept to automate call centers, hotel receptions, personal trainers, or any type of customer service.

Through this project we will :-

- Understand how the Reformer works
- Explore the MultiWoz dataset
- Process the data to feed it into the model
- Train your model
- Generate a dialogue by feeding a question to the model
